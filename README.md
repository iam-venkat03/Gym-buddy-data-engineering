# Gym Buddy Data Engineering


## Description

This is GymBuddy System! <br />
This project is to showcase my understanding of Data Engineering concepts.
<br />
The final goal of this project is to do analysis on the data, and to recommend a gym member for each gym members (hence the name GymBuddy) to accompany them to the gym.

## Concepts

### Front end development (HTML, CSS, JS)

* In this project, I have tried to developed a web application that takes input from the user and allows them to enter details such as 
Age, Gender, Height, Weight, Preferred Time etc, Gym Goals etc.. <br />
* Then the entered details are viewed for review before final submission. 
Once the submission is done, the details will added to the database. <br />
* The database used in this project is sqllite3 as it comes pre installed package in python.
I used Flask framework for deployment.
* Once the data is finally submitted, there is an option to download the data from the table as an excel so that analysis can be performed.
